ResourceType: AwsVpc
Description: Ensure that VPC has enabled service endpoints (e.g., S3, DynamoDB, etc.). This check verifies that VPC endpoints are available and functional for services within the VPC.
Risk: If a VPC does not have any enabled service endpoints, resources in the VPC may not have direct access to the services they need, which can hinder functionality and performance.
