Severity: high

ResourceType: AwsIamUser

  Recommendation:
    Text: "It is more secure to start with a minimum set of permissions and grant additional permissions as necessary, rather than starting with permissions that are too lenient and then trying to tighten them later. List policies an analyze if permissions are the least possible to conduct business activities."
