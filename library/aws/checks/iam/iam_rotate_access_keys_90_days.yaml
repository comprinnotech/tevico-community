Description: Ensure that IAM access keys are rotated every 90 days. Regular key rotation reduces the potential risk of compromised access keys by limiting the time window in which a key can be exploited.

Risk: >-
 If access keys are not rotated regularly, they can become vulnerable to unauthorized use, especially if exposed or compromised. Stale access keys increase the likelihood of security breaches, as long-standing keys could potentially fall into malicious hands. Regular rotation of access keys ensures a more secure environment by reducing the risk of long-term exposure.

  Recommendation:
    Text: >-
      Rotate IAM access keys every 90 days to minimize the risk of unauthorized access. Implement a solution to enforce this rotation and consider using AWS Secrets Manager,AWS Systems Manager and AWS Lambda for automated key rotation.
