Description: Ensure that IAM access keys are rotated every 90 days. Regular key rotation reduces the potential risk of compromised access keys by limiting the time window in which a key can be exploited.

Risk: >-
 If access keys are not rotated regularly, they can become vulnerable to unauthorized use, especially if exposed or compromised. Stale access keys increase the likelihood of security breaches, as long-standing keys could potentially fall into malicious hands. Regular rotation of access keys ensures a more secure environment by reducing the risk of long-term exposure.
