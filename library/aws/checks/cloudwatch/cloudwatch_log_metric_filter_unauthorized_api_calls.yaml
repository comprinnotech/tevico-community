Description: Ensure that CloudWatch log metric filters and alarms are configured to detect unauthorized API calls
Risk:
  Unauthorized API calls may indicate attempted security breaches or compromised credentials. Without proper monitoring and alerting, these events could go undetected, potentially leading to unauthorized access to resources, data breaches, or other security incidents.
