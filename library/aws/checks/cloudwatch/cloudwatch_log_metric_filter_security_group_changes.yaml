CheckTitle: Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for security group changes

ServiceName: cloudwatch
SubServiceName: logs
ResourceIdTemplate: arn:aws:logs:region:account-id:log-group:log-group-name:*
Severity: high
ResourceType: AwsCloudWatchLogMetricFilter
Description: Ensure that CloudWatch log metric filters and alarms are configured to detect changes to security groups
Risk:
  Security groups control the ingress and egress traffic to AWS resources. Changes to security groups could potentially expose resources to unauthorized network access or indicate malicious activity. Without proper monitoring and alerting, these changes could go undetected, leading to security vulnerabilities.

Remediation:
  Code:
    CLI: |
      aws logs put-metric-filter \
        --log-group-name <log-group-name> \
        --filter-name SecurityGroupChangesFilter \
        --filter-pattern '{ ($.eventName = AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress) || ($.eventName = AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress) || ($.eventName = RevokeSecurityGroupIngress) || ($.eventName = RevokeSecurityGroupEgress) || ($.eventName = CreateSecurityGroup) || ($.eventName = DeleteSecurityGroup) }' \
        --metric-transformations \
            metricName=SecurityGroupChangesCount,metricNamespace=CloudTrailMetrics,metricValue=1

  Recommendation:
    Text: |
      Set up CloudWatch metric filters with patterns to capture security group changes and ensure they are monitored with alarms. This enables automatic alerting for potential security-related changes to your network configuration.
