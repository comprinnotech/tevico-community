  Recommendation:
    Text: "Adding MFA delete to an S3 bucket requires additional authentication when you change the version state of your bucket or delete an object version, adding another layer of security in the event your security credentials are compromised or unauthorized access is granted. Note that MFA Delete can only be enabled by the bucket owner using their root account credentials."
