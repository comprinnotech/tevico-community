  Ensure that AWS Organizations service is currently in use. This check verifies if the AWS account is part of an AWS Organization, confirming centralized management.

Risk: The risk associated with not being part of an AWS Organizations is that it can lead to a lack of centralized management and control over the AWS accounts in an organization. This can make it difficult to enforce security policies consistently across all accounts and can also result in increased costs due to inefficiencies in resource usage. Additionally, not being part of an AWS Organizations can make it harder to track and manage account usage and access.
