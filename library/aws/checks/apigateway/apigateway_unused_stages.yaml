CheckType: [Cost Optimization, Operational Excellence]
ServiceName: apigateway
SubServiceName: ""
ResourceIdTemplate: arn:partition:apigateway:region::/restapis/api-id/stages/stage-name
Severity: low
ResourceType: AwsApiGatewayStage
Description: This check identifies Amazon API Gateway REST API stages that have had no request activity in the past 30 days. These stages may be legacy, unused, or forgotten deployments that contribute to maintenance overhead or additional costs if features like caching are enabled.
Risk: Leaving unused API Gateway stages deployed can lead to unnecessary CloudWatch log generation, enabled caching costs, and increased attack surface if publicly accessible.
